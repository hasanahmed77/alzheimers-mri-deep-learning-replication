Alzheimer’s Disease Classification Replication

This repository replicates the experiments from:
[“Classifying and diagnosing
Alzheimer’s disease with deep
learning using 6735 brain MRI
images”](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-08092-1.pdf).

**Dataset**: MRI images of Alzheimer’s patients (Mild, Moderate, Severe)

***Models**: CNN architectures including Xception, VGG19, VGG16 and InceptionResNetV2 

**Features:**
  - Data preprocessing and augmentation
  - Model training with checkpoints
  - Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - Result visualization and plots
